### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Javascript operators come in multiple forms; assignment, arithmetic, comparison/relational,
    string, and logical.)
2. (Javascript has reserved words, these words cannot be used as variables as they are important
    to the language.)
3. (Javascript is a loosely typed language and variables do not need to specify which data type when
    declared, instead they will depend on the value assigned.)
